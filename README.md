# Survival-Prediction-using-logistic-regression
1) Performed data exploratory techniques like Countplots, histogram on Titanic Dataset provided by Kaggle to preprocess the data
2) Split the dataset intro training and testing in a 80:20 ratio consisting of Name, age, sex and other features 
3) Executed Feature Engineering by enumerating the string data and cleaning training dataset with variable selection techniques.
4) Employed Logistic Regression model which predicts survival of the passenger with over 78% accuracy
